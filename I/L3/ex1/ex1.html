    'Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times
    like these if one has any feeling?' said Anna Pavlovna. 'You are
    staying the whole evening, I hope?'

    'And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I
    must put in an appearance there,' said the prince. 'My daughter is
    coming for me to take me there.'

    'I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these
    festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.'

    'If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would
    have been put off,' said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by
    force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.

    'Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's
    dispatch? You know everything.'

    'What can one say about it?' replied the prince in a cold,
    listless tone. 'What has been decided? They have decided that
    Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to
    burn ours.'
